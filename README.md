# Project Overview

## Why:
cause i hate having to type "s..s..h..space..etc.......", it takes to long, so this project solves that allowing you too copy the commands you need to open a ssh seasion to your remote ssh server, it also give you the command to start a monitoring seasion with htop or btop with 1 command.

Enjoy:)

P.S. there is still more to come
